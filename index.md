BlackPool is a new fund operating within the NFT industry: managing a range of assets from sports cards to game items to digital art.

BlackPool is the first decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) built solely for NFT gaming and trading. Our strategies will be based on our long-term passion for gaming and art, as we combine professional data analytics and machine learning to provide the best returns for our users.

We will lead the way in providing financial derivatives to digital marketplaces, by offering services such as asset valuation indices, leasing, insurance mechanisms, and more.

BlackPool firmly believes in the long term value of scarce digital assets, and understand that a high level of specialisation in each NFT platform is required to maximise value creation. Therefore, we will always seek to employ expertise to improve our performance on each platform.

BlackPool generates cashflows and accrues value for the DAO by:

taking arbitrage opportunities between primary and secondary markets
loaning out assets
buying and selling assets based on news
scouting for assets that will accrue in value and buying early
in-game competition
