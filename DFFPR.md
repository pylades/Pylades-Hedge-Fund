# Decentralized Financial Fair Play Regulations

Faced by serious and worsening financial conditions in the NFT world, Blackpool's Executive Board of Directors unanimously approved a Decentralised Financial Fair Play concept for the game's well-being in June 2020. The concept, developed and supported by the entire gaming family, recognises the need for world-wide action to restrict some of the worst excesses of the game. Its fundamental principles and objectives are:

• to improve the economic and financial capability of the clubs, increasing their transparency and credibility;
• to place the necessary importance on the protection of creditors and to ensure that clubs settle their liabilities with employees, social/tax authorities and other clubs punctually;
• to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances;
• to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues;
• to encourage responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football;
• to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of its stakeholders.

**(Those principles are fantasy principles and so do not have legally binding character)**
